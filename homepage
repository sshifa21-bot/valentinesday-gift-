        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
It was the 2nd of May. I don’t know what happened, but I decided to give the dating app one last chance, so I downloaded it again. I was just scrolling when you appeared in front of me. I don’t know what came over me, but I followed you and even wrote you something. That’s how our chat began.
<br><br>
After a while of chatting (which, in reality, was just one day), you asked for my Instagram. I had just made a new account, so I gave it to you. I think I told you I didn’t have any pictures, but you didn’t care. I guess you just wanted to know me better. So, we continued talking there.
<br><br>
One day, after less than a week, you asked me to call for the first time. I remember that day very clearly—I was sitting on the bus, heading home from work. When you called, I was so nervous. I didn’t know if I should pick up. Would you laugh at my Urdu accent? I’m shy, my Urdu isn’t perfect, I talk fast—would you understand me? But I put all my thoughts aside and accepted the call.
<br><br>
Honestly, I don’t remember everything we talked about, but I do remember saying I preferred calls over chats—which is exactly what happened the next day. You told me about your family, about your mom, everything. Two days later, we switched to a video call, and I saw you for the first time. My thoughts were: Shifa, is this real? Damn, he is hot! Handsome. That was the exact moment I fell in love with you. I think we even talked about our feelings that day. I know how you said “I love you” to me for the first time.
<br><br>
I wish I had the chats on Instagram, but I deleted them because I was scared someone would see. But it’s all in my heart and brain, and no one can erase it. From that moment, we continued talking on Instagram. Then you asked for my number, and I gave it to you. After a while, you asked me if I wanted to be your wife—and I said yes. You can’t imagine how happy I was. I finally found someone I could talk to easily, someone who sees me as I am, not someone trying to change me. Someone who wants me to be happy. For that, babe, I love you so much.
<br><br>
I wanted to tell my parents that I wanted a man who lives in Lahore, who loves me for who I am inside, not for my looks or weight, but for my character. I am so thankful to have you in my life. You are here with me in my worst moments and my happiest ones. I still remember what we planned to name our daughter. Your mother’s name, I think, was Shamsa—just a guess. Even though she isn’t here with you, I’m sure she is happy to see you happy. I never told you this, but I am thankful that she raised a son who is well-mannered and kind-hearted.
<br><br>
I love you. I hope we will have a wonderful married life together.
